# News App

This application is designed to work with the service [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/). On the Home page, you can see a list of top news. By clicking on the news you are interested in, you will see the details.

You will need an API key to use the app. You can get it after registering at [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/) or use this: <code>6aa32a71252d4552bb2c965f3fcc64e4</code> <em>(The API works only for a locally running app)</em>
